# Describing-the-social-network-of-actors
Using the IMDB dataset, I sorted out all the bollywood actors, and who they worked with to form a graph showing how everyone is connected. Further if someone wants to connect with someone other, how do they communicate.

The exported data from the ipynb notebook is imported into Kumu ( a data visualisation service ).
The map visualisation can be seen here.
